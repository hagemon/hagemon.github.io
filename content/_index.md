Yize Le, received his bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from [Fuzhou Univerisity](https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn) (2013-2017) and master's degree in Computer Science from [Chongqing Univerisity](http://www.cs.cqu.edu.cn) (2017-2020). 

He has experiences on iOS/Web development and has ability on building AI models. He studied on deep metric learning, deep hashing and big data analytics in past years, but has recently become more interested in trustworthy AI and software analytics. 

I wrote some [posts](/posts) to document learnt knowledge, keep updating!

#### ü§ñÔ∏è Machine Learning

- Deep Metric Learning

- Deep Hashing for Image Retrieval

- Cross Modal Retrieval

- Paper: [Adversarial Metric Learning with Naive Similarity Discriminator](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/transinf/E103.D/6/E103.D_2019EDP7278/_article/-char/en)

- Also worked on: 
    - [Distribution-Aware Hierarchical Weighting Method for Deep Metric Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9414864)
    - [Relationship-Aware Hard Negative Generation in Deep Metric Learning](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343751365_Relationship-Aware_Hard_Negative_Generation_in_Deep_Metric_Learning)

#### üçé iOS/MacOS Development
- [TapMemo](https://github.com/hagemon/TapMemo) and its [iOS version](https://github.com/hagemon/TapMemo-for-iOS), a convenient markdown-based memo tool. Simply press "cmd+shift+D" to write down your thought at any time.

- [Clipin](https://github.com/hagemon/Clipin), a handy screenshot tool to capture and pin a region of screen, whenever you need to keep a reference to certain information (like images). I usually use it for refering images of paper, when images and content are in different pages.

- [TimeTo](https://github.com/hagemon/TimeTo), a reminder for things that need to be done routinely, like replacing razors, toothbrush heads etc.

- Member of [W2fzu](https://www.w2fzu.com), founder of [FZUHelper](https://fzuhelper.w2fzu.com). An essential tool for your college life in Fuzhou University.

#### üï∏Ô∏è Web Development

- [EmojiSlot](https://hagemon.github.io/emoji-slot), a funny and useless toy to generate emoji randomly, just for fun :)
